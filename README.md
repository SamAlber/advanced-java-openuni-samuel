# Advanced Java Course Projects - OPENU

This repository is created to store the assignments for the course 20554 by the Open University of Israel.

The exercises are presented in `assignments.pdf`.

## Installation Process

The installation of JavaFX can be tricky.

I used VSCode with the JavaFX SDK, downloaded from the [Gluon website](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/).

Optimization details for VSCode can be found in the following [guide on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AubJaosfI-0&t=471s&ab_channel=BoostMyTool).
